Code for CS372 Final

I created a very simple implementation of a Proxy Design Pattern.
I found that Proxy Design Patterns are very useless in small amounts of code like I have done.
This would be amazing for impementations in bigger projects, where there are many classes that affect similar things, 
  but don't fall under the use of polymorphism.
